\section{Riemann vs. Lebesgue}

\subsection{The Motivation}
Our goal when we integrate a function is to find the amount of `space' between the graph and x-axis (or the Abscissa if you're fancy). It's pretty difficult to say how much space an arbitrary curve takes up, but we can work out the area of rectangles very easily --- by calculating the {\em base $\times$ height}. Riemann integration takes advantage of this, and defines the integral of a function $f:\R \rightarrow \R$ by first bounding it from above with rectangular functions and finding the smallest of these areas (which is would be an upper bound for the area of the function), then we bound the function from below and find an lower bound, then we hope that these two bounds match up.

If the domain of our function (the `x-axis'), is $\R^2$ instead of just $\R$, we'd actually calculating a volume by finding the `space' between the graph and the axis. Curves are bad enough, but it's even harder to find the volume under a surface. Basic Riemann Integration doesn't apply to these functions --- but if we wanted, we could make a similar observation and simpification. The analog to a rectangle in $\R^3$ is a cuboid, and we and think of its size as being calculated in much the same way as in $\R^2$; the size of the base (which is now an area, instead of a length) $\times$ the height. It'd be nice if there were a way to take advantage of this so that we could integrate any function where we can make sense of \emph{`the size of the base.'} With this is mind, lets clear up some of the terms we are going to use:

\begin{description}
\item[\em Lebesgue integration\/] is the method of integration defined above. Just like Riemann Integration, it is used to find the space between the graph of a function and the domain. However, unlike Riemann, the domain can be any set at all. Thinking back to rectangles and cuboids and $base \times height$, if we wanted make sense of what it means for there to be space between the graph and the x-axis, we should be able to make sense of the `size' of parts of the domain, so that we can figure out how big our base is and multiply that by the height$\ldots$
%
\item[\em The Lebesgue Measure\/] seems then like it'd be a way to assign sizes to, or `measure' sets any domain; but it is not! It's a term used specifically when we give sizes to the subsets of $\R^n$, and those sizes (or `measures') coincided with our usual idea of the size of a set in $\R^n$ --- i.e. it is used when we are considering functions $\R^n \supset Y \rightarrow \R$, and in $\R$ the measure (length) of the interval $[1, 0]$ is 1, in $\R^2$ the measure (area) of the rectangle $[1, 0] \times [1, 0]$ is 1, in $\R^3$ the measure (volume) of the cube $[1, 0] \times [1, 0] \times [1, 0]$ is 1$\ldots$ etc. 
%
\item[\bf \em The Lebesgue Integral\/] is what we get when we do Lebesgue Integration on a set with the Lebesgue Measure on it. i.e. it's Integral of normal functions $\R^n \supset Y \rightarrow \R$. This is the (basically) the same domain as the Riemann integral and so we'd want to check that the Lebesgue Integral and the Riemann integral match up --- and then see if the Lebesgue integral is better in some way.
\end{description}

Already, we can see an improvement over Riemann Integration; \emph{Lebesgue Integration} is defined on any set at all (kind of), and even the more restricted \emph{Lebesgue Integral} can be calculated directly for any $\R^n$ --- so no double/triple integration nonsense. To see another benefit of the Lebesgue Integral over Riemann, let's look at the canonical example of a function for which the Riemann Integral fails; $f\colon \R \rightarrow \R,\ \ f(x) = \mathbbm{1}_\Q(x)$ (Figure \ref{fig:rational}). This is also an example of a \emph{Simple Function} since it is just the \emph{Indicator Function} of a measurable set, but lets not get ahead of ourselves$\ldots$ First, we should define the Riemann Integral.
