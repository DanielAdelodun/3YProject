\section{List of Definitions}
Here I list some definitions which I did not have time to work into the main body of the text. I skip some definitions that you'd expect most maths students to know. The notation here mostly follows the style documented at the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols}{Wikipedia} page for mathematical notation. Sets are normally denoted with capitals, $A, B, C\ldots$, and sets of [sub]sets in calligraphic font $\A, \B, \mathcal{C}\ldots$ Notably, the power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ of a set X follows this pattern.
